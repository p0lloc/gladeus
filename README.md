### âš  All APIs are subject to drastic changes.

Set of libraries used for things commonly done in Paper plugins. This is highly Paper dependent due to built-in Adventure implementations, it will not work on Spigot.

The philosophy behind this project is that modules should be able to work well together. 
Each module has its own README file where you can read more about the respective module. 

### To-Do
- Investigate performance, maybe benchmarks? :o
- Properly annotate stuff
- Add more documentation
